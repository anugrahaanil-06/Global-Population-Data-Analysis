# Global-Population-Data-Analysis

# Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize key insights from global population statistics.  
The analysis focuses on demographic patterns, population density, gender distribution, and age composition, helping to identify global trends and regional contrasts in population structure.
The dashboard serves as a comprehensive data storytelling tool — combining data modeling, transformation, and visualization to turn raw data into meaningful insights.

# Objectives

- To visualize global population distribution and highlight leading countries.
- To compare male and female population ratios across nations.
- To study population density variations among top populated countries.
- To analyze age-based segments (0–14 years and 60+ years) for demographic trends.
- To present data in a visually compelling, interactive Power BI dashboard.

# Insights Derived

- India and China together account for a major portion of the world’s population.
- India shows one of the highest population densities, followed by Pakistan and Nigeria.
- The sex ratio indicates gender imbalances in several regions, with varying male-to-female proportions.
- Developed countries exhibit a higher aging population (60+), while developing countries show a younger demographic.
- Female and male population distributions follow similar trends, emphasizing growth patterns in highly populated nations.

# Tools & Technologies
